        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          The Bankston family has been in business for over 40 years. Rodney and
          Kay Bankston started Bankston Tire and Appliance in Waco, Texas in the
          early 70s. The business flourished under their leadership and when
          their sons Brent and Brad started to show interest in business, they
          knew they had the beginning of something unique. With the Tire and
          Appliance store still in full swing, Rodney and Kay decided to put the
          "Next Generation Plan" into motion. In the early 80s, as the boys got
          older and showed interest collecting, a natural business started to
          evolve.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1985, Bankston's Used Books opened with a small comic and sports
          card selection, carrying mostly hardback and paperback books at the
          time. Meanwhile, the collectible industry was poised to explode as
          both comic books and baseball cards started to gain popularity. Brent
          and Brad fervently enjoyed the business and applied the same character
          driven "customer first" attitude they were taught at the Tire and
          Appliance store to the their new business. Now, all these years later,
          we have Bankston's Sports Memorabilia, Comics & Collectibles, as well
          as <a href="https://www.austinbooks.com/">Austin Books and Comics</a>
          with friendly, knowledgeable staff ready to assist you with any comic
          or collectible needs in order continue the tradition began all those
          years ago by Rodney and Kay Bankston.
