        <h2>Let Us Welcome You Home</h2>
        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
          I'm Angelina McCann. I live in Abilene, Texas with my husband and our
          three spoiled dogs. We are parents to five sons, so you can imagine
          how I needed a "girly craft" space!
        </p>
        <p>
          I inherited the creative gene from my mother, who had her own craft
          shop. We started The Shop on Santa Monica in 2018 and now there's no
          turning back! I love going into the craft room, spending hours making
          beautiful things, and now you can benefit from my inability to sit
          still! I refuse to design or sell anything that I wouldn't hang on my
          own front door or display in my home. You can depend on a high quality
          product from The Shop on Santa Monica; we want your home to feel warm
          and welcoming to your family and friends (and be the envy of your
          neighborhood!).
        </p>
